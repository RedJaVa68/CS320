# CS320

The way to ensure code is functional and secure is to test the code and check the dependencies against the vulnerability database.

A way to interpret user needs is to create non-functional requirements for the program. This ensures the code meets what a user typically expects in the code.

I approach designing software by meeting the functional and non functional requirements of the software. I interpret what the customer and user needs. I also ensure the code uses best coding practices to minimize bugs and vulnerabilities.
